# "PS: I wrote this reply 100% by hand."*

In an age of AI content, Pudding lets you prove you're human and that you put in the work. 

No AI hesitates. No AI deletes three versions of a sentence. No AI stares at a blank cursor for 30 seconds. But you do. And that's what makes your work human and unique.

# Pudding: Where the proof is

## Show the work you put in

> I kept adding "P.S.: This was 100% hand-written by me without AI" to everything I published. But who believes that anymore? Everyone says they didn't use AI. I needed a way to actually prove it—to show my messy, human writing process. So I built Pudding.

**Now you can PROVE your writing is human.**

Pudding records every keystroke, every deletion, every moment you pause searching for the right word. All the messy, beautiful evidence that a real human wrote your work.
